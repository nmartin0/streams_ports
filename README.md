This repository contains a port of the SVR4-derived STREAMS interfaces and
respective implementations to BSD. Initial development here will include
separating the STREAMS functionality from OpenSolaris and its derivatives
in order to maximize portability to a BSD operating system. Code in this
repository is licensed under the CDDL 1.0 where applicable, and files not
explicitly licensed should be regarded as PROPRIETARY SOURCE CODE with its
